// run this on servers to update them
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y upgrade && sudo systemctl reboot

// this is how to ssh into something
ssh ubuntu@167.99.109.153

// cd into this git project, then edit the hosts file with new ips

// ssh into each new server as root to avoid any ssh issues with first ansible commands
ssh root@167.99.109.153

// run this to make non root user with passwordless sudo
ansible-playbook -i hosts ~/kube-cluster/initial.yml

// now we have 3 servers with usernames of ubuntu

// need to have this installed on mac to use ansible properly
brew install hudochenkov/sshpass/sshpass

// NOTE - ssh is behaving incorrectly.  i am updating it to use a password to do ssh to trick it into working
// adding -t to ssh logins seems to make it work??


// Upgrade ansible
sudo pip install ansible --upgrade

// uninstall something on brew
brew uninstall pyparsing --force


// now saying fuck it, will run ansible from node inside digital ocean
sudo apt install ansible
